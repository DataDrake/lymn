[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/DataDrake/lymn)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/DataDrake/lymn) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DataDrake/lymn.svg)]()

## Motivation

While working on a game for Ludum Dare 48, I started working on an engine for building interactive fiction (IF) games in YAML. While I didn't manage to write a game before the end of LD48, `lymn` is the evolution of that engine.

## Name

**limn**
> *to depict or describe in painting or words.*

`lymn` is an intentional misspelling of `limn` to recognize that the scripting is done in `YAML`, while also being a play on the fact that it "paints" the screen with text.

## Goals

 * Script IF in YAML:
   - Scenes
   - Events
   - Choices
   - Character Stats
   - Inventory (TBD)
 * Built in Go on top of [Ebiten](ebiten.org)
 * Support fonts generated by [Pixie](github.com/DataDrake/pixie)
 * Be as easy to use as possible
 * A+ Rating on [Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/DataDrake/lymn)

## Requirements

* Go 1.16 (for embed)
* OS-Specific Ebiten dependencies: [See Here](https://ebiten.org/documents/install.html)
* Make

## Usage
